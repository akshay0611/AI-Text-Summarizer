# **AI Text Summarizer App** 🚀

This project is part of **Postman's Project-Based Learning** module, where I built an **AI-powered web application** to summarize lengthy text into concise, readable summaries. The application leverages **Node.js** and integrates with the **Hugging Face Inference API** for real-time text summarization.
